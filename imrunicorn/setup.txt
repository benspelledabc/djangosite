The nuclear option? Back up your db, for safety, then delete the migrations folder from each of your apps, and delete all rows from the django_migrations table in your db.
Now run ./manage.py makemigrations. That will create a new initial migration file for each of your apps. If you were to then try to run ./manage.py migrate it would fail because all of that schema already exists and can’t be re-created. But you do need to tell Django that everything specified in the new migrations is already accounted for, so give it the —fake argument:
./manage.py migrate —fake
