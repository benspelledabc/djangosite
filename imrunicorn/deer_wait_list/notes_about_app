This is to be used as a way to document a list of who wants what.
ordered list for who's next in the list for deer and a list of what they want
if they are next up but dont want a full deer... who gets the rest? etc etc


Message from lady:
Add a who wants deer list to the website. should be name, place for me to add dates when i have them some,
and a space for notes about what they liked, want next time.. etc.

after talking, we decided it should be like a short order. add items on the fly and still have notes. each person
would have an entry per day.

for example: each deer has 2 loins, 2 backstraps and 2 "other"
if personA wants 1 loin and 1 backstrap, the rest rolls over to personB
personB wants 2 loins and 2 other. this means the deer1 has 1 backstrap that goes to personC and personB is filled with deer2
personC gets the remaining backstrap and then goes on the wait list for the rest if they wanted more than that.

each person will get portions of deer and the rest "rolls over" to the next person that wants that cut/item

perceived_thankfulness is a private (admin only) score 0-10 on how much we feel they express gratitude. this maybe be
used later but for now its just a mental note.
