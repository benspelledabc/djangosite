        <h4>This is a very crude map to get to the range at the farm. The road is a
            tractor road therefore low riding cars will not make it! When GPS
            says you are there and you start to go in the driveway
            STAY LEFT (<span style="color: red; background-color: #0f0f0f ">RED</span>).
            <br /><br />If you go to the
            right (<span style="color: blue; background-color: #0f0f0f ">BLUE</span>) you will end up at
            the wrong section of the property.
            <br /><br />The (<span style="color: white; background-color: #0f0f0f ">White</span>)
            circle on the map is where a Backhoe/tractor MIGHT be parked. This is
            also the most likely spot your car will bottom out if it's too low. Watch the road!
            <br /><br />It might even be worth telling me the color/type of car you're driving BEFORE
            you come onto the property. There are no trespassing signs up, don't get caught with
            your pants down.!
